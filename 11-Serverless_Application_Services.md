## 1. Architecture Evolution - Part 1 - Monolithic and Tiered

#

### summary

- 2 part lesson, first part covers how applications can be evolved from monolithic to tiered architecture

### concepts

- monolithic architecture
  - one box handles everything. see cattube example
  - cons: one failure to part affects everything. fail together. also scale together since on same server, and bill together

- tiered architecture
  - things are still connected together, but can scale independently
  - can use internal load balancers to manage each tier's load
  - allows for horizontal scaling and HA
  - cons: each tier is still dependent on each other so can't scale to zero and could still fail
